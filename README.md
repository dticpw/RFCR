# RFCR
Federated learning enables collaborative training for cross-modal retrieval while preserving data privacy. However, the effectiveness of federated learning will be severely affected by noisy clients, as their local updates can propagate noise through the comunication between server and clients. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{R}obust \textbf{F}ederated \textbf{C}ross-modal \textbf{R}etrieval (RFCR). The framework incorporates an adaptive aggregation weighting strategy alongside a noise-aware filtering mechanism, which together suppress the influence of noisy pairs during training. Extensive experiments on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that RFCR can integrate multiple clients to achieve superior retrieval accuracy while substantially mitigating the negative impact of noisy correspondences
